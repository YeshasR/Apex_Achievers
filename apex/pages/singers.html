                        <p class="card-text">Michael Jackson is without a doubt one of the best singers of all time, if
                            not
                            the greatest. Like others, he was given a title: the “King of Pop”. He's one of the most
                            significant cultural figures and is the greatest entertainer in the history of music. Even
                            attempting to talk about all of his awards would be pointless. They even extend into the
                            dance
                            world. He is truly the king.</p>

                        <p class="card-text">Tupac's music takes you on a trip through his life and ideas. Tupac
                            considers
                            rap as an art form, not merely a means of entertainment. Poetry is more important than
                            nursery
                            rhymes, and intelligence is more important than wit. Even in his light tunes meant just for
                            enjoyment, he has a high degree of creativity. Tupac Shakur was a real revolutionary who
                            influenced numerous cultural shifts in the hip-hop industry.</p>

                        <p class="card-text">Jay-Z is a rapper who can be highly sophisticated but prefers to keep
                            things
                            simple. This genuine skill allows him to focus on honing and communicating his message. No
                            other
                            rapper has had the same level of consistency as Jay-Z. Listening to Jay-Z is like listening
                            to a
                            man who has lived his life to the fullest and has a lot of experiences to share. He's the
                            richest American musician. Jay-Z has won 22 Grammy awards and is also one of the
                            highest-selling
                            artists.</p>
